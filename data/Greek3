I’m going to wrap things up now, so I can be back in the morning to cover all Monday’s developments.

Here’s a quick closing summary, as another gripping chapter in Greece’s debt crisis closes, and another one opens.....

Greece’s leftwing leader Alexis Tsipras has emerged triumphant from a snap general election after securing a dramatic victory over his conservative rival, despite a turbulent first term in office and predictions that the race was too close to call after he accepted a crushing eurozone-led austerity programme during his first term in office.

The charismatic leader looked set to be returned to power with a near repeat of the stunning win that catapulted his Syriza party into office in January.

With most of the ballot papers counted, Syriza is leading with a 35.5% share of the vote compared with 28.2% for the centre-right New Democracy party. Speaking in Athens, Tsipras declared the election a victory for the people. “This victory belongs to the people and those who dream of a better tomorrow and we’ll achieve it with hard work,” he said.

Jubilant supporters, clearly relieved at the result, took to the streets in celebration, with many singing and dancing outside Syriza’s main election marquee in central Athens.

Tsipras told supporters that he would tackle endemic corruption in the country. “The mandate that the Greek people have given is is a crystal clear mandate to get rid of the regime of corruption and vested issues,” he said. “We will show how effective we will be. We will make Greece a stronger place for the weak and vulnerable, a fairer place.”

Winning the election could be the easy part, given the scale of the financial crisis in Greece.

Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: 

The fresh dose of deflationary measures in Greece’s new €86bn (£62bn) bailout programme, agreed in July after Tsipras folded under pressure from creditors, will deepen a depression similar in its severity to those that afflicted Germany and the United States in the 1930s.

The Greek economy has contracted by 29% since 2009 and is still shrinking after months of financial turmoil. Yet Greece remains part of a single currency that has emerged bloodied but intact. All the main parties contending the election were committed to continuing with the bailout that Tsipras negotiated in the summer.

Even so, the election will have consequences. Syriza has done well enough to form a workable coalition, thereby avoiding the need for another election and removing one of the hurdles before Greece has the first review of its bailout some time before the end of the year.

Tonight’s celebrations in Athens were more low-key than after January’s general election.

But some Syriza supporters still put on a show, as Tsipas took the crowds’ applause and posed for photos.

Analyst: Tsipras is the only player in town

The main takeaway from tonight’s result is that Tsipras has become the only player in town, says Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence.

He predicts more pain for the right-wing New Democracy party, which failed to get as close to Syriza as the polls had suggested.

Tsipras’s supreme political skill is only matched by the incompetence of his political adversaries. This pattern is further supported by the fact that ND will go through another internal catharsis, with the new leader to be elected only in early 2016. The main opposition party will not be able to come back any time soon, limiting its ability to mount significant resistance to the next government.

Similarly, Potami’s poor performance will likely trigger soul searching within the party.

Against this backdrop, Tsipras’ only real rival could soon become the political system itself and its connections with business, Wolfango continues:

The SYRIZA leader will now have to deliver on his pledge to fight corruption and the power of vested interests. Having made this promise for months, there will be no alibi if he does not deliver. But this fight could quickly poison the entire political scene, especially if figures close to mainstream parties are targeted.

Just 30% of the votes are left to be counted, and there’s no real change in the projections. Eight parties are on track to win seats.
