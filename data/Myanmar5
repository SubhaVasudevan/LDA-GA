Suu Kyi vows to be "above the President" if her party wins
Agence France-Presse: 5 November 2015
"I have said I am going to be above the president,” Suu Kyi said in bullish remarks to reporters ahead of Sunday’s vote, which her National League for Democracy (NLD) party hopes to sweep. Asked to elaborate, she cryptically replied: “I have already made plans”.

“I will run the government and we will have a president who will work in accordance with the policies of the NLD,” she told reporters gathered on the lawn of her Yangon home, the same mansion she was confined to during years of house arrest by the former generals.
